    Welcome to Screw Me Politics, 
    %br 
    the demo site for Screw Me Yale!
  %p Screws at Yale are blind-date dances; you set your roommate up with someone, and they set you up. Of course, this presents a huge coordination problem, with students rushing to find dates, last-minute cancellations and frantic phone calls.
  %p 
    To help, there's
    %a{:href => "http://screwmeyale.com", :target => "_blank"} Screw Me Yale
    \. 
  %p
    This demo site is to replicate the functionality—matchmaking for blind-dates—for non-Yale students, but instead of students, we'll use your favorite characters from in and around Washington, D.C. However instead of 
    %b gender 
    and 
    %b sexual preference, 
    we'll be using 
    %b political bias
    and a rough measure of the person's 
    %b willingness to compromise with other viewpoints.
  %p
    We know Rush Limbaugh would never want to go on a date with Joe Biden; but who knows, maybe Biden and Boehner would be a good match! Only Screw Me Politics will tell—click the button below to get started!
